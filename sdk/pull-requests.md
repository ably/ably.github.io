# Ably SDK Team: Guidance on Pull Requests

We have a few locations where standards and best practices have been captured - however they rarely reflect our current practices on the SDK Team, in particular where we're working in open source.

This document is intended as a canonical reference documenting how the SDK Team prefers to process pull requests in the public domain / open source.
It should be read alongside wider guidance, standards and best practices defined by us for [Git](git.md) and [GitHub](github.md).

- All PRs should be approved by at least one SDK Team member who maintains that client library
- Ideally, in most cases, PRs should be landed (merged) to the `main` branch by the Lead Engineer responsible for that client library
- Avoid publishing comments into that public domain that just represent housekeeping or reminders to other team members - these should more appropriately be handled as internal messaging over Slack (probably via the appropriate SDK repository channel)
