# Contributing

This repository contains markdown files and is intended to be consumed directly from GitHub's repository browser.

## Lint

To check your formatting use:

    npm run lint

If this is the first time you've run that command then you will first need to use:

    npm install

This same Lint command is run in the CI environment by the [Check workflow](.github/workflows/check.yaml).
