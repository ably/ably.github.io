Please send all invoices by the last day of the month. E.g. July invoices should be dated for the 31st of July and include all work in July.

Invoices can be sent in more frequently if you prefer, on a weekly or biweekly schedule and according to your contract agreement.

<summary>When should I expect to receive payment for the work I have done?</summary>

Payment runs are completed weekly on a Monday, we aim to have the invoice paid within a week of the invoice being received, and will guarantee to have the invoice paid within 2 weeks.

When the usual payment run falls on a Bank Holiday Monday, payment runs will then move to the next day. You can see a list of UK Bank Holidays [here](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays).
