## Your Responsibilities

### Communication

At the start of each work session, publish a self-stand-up via Slack, to include:

- What you achieved last session
- What Jira ticket you will be working on this session

You must flag via Slack when you are running low on work.
We'll then work with you to line up the next series of Jira tickets.

### Order, Scope, Venue and Commitment

- Work on Jira tickets only, in priority order
- Update them with comments and by moving them across columns
- Where you're working on something open source, prefer to interact with linked issues via GitHub's interface - this 'Github First' approach is important to some teams (for example, the SDK Team)
- Commit to the minimum number of regular hours you have agreed with us

## Ably's Responsibilities

We recognise that the relationship we're building with the freelancers that work with us is deeply symbiotic in nature, therefore we want to make it clear what we want to commit to you.

We'll:

- Make sure there are enough Jira tickets at any one time
- Make sure Jira tickets are prioritised
- Group Jira tickets into milestones or releases, so we can aim for tangible advances
- Review your work in a timely manner

## Technology needs Humanity

This is one of Ably's [core values](https://ably.com/blog/ably-values),
also sometimes abbreviated to 'tech needs humanity'.

We mention it here because we want to explicitly acknowledge that we're all humans.
This means that we know we'll all make mistakes at times, or perhaps not quite match up to expectations all of the time. :heart:

In the same way that we will do our best to remain flexible where possible and understand when things aren't going as well as they could be for you in respect of matching up to your responsibilities, we expect the same from you. We are a fast growing company with individuals who, day-to-day, have to wear many hats and spin many plates at times. Please bear with us if we can't always match up to our responsibilities as outlined above. :smile:

## Definitions

- **work session**: This should be interpreted as "every time you come online after a period of significant break lasting more than a few hours". There is flexibility to bend this definition but that will depend on the needs of the team you are working with.
- **via Slack**: This will depend on the team you are working with, however the appropriate channel to feed your updates into will be clearly indicated to you by us.
