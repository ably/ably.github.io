## Background to Ably

Ably is an enterprise-ready pub/sub messaging platform with integrated services to easily build complete realtime functionality delivered directly to end-users. We power the apps people and enterprises depend on everyday. Developers from startups to industrial giants build on Ably to simplify engineering, minimize DevOps overhead, and increase development velocity.

## Why does this site exist?

One of Ably’s core values is being “Open for all”.  We believe that when we’re open, we’re better collaborators, communicators and creators. Whether open source, standards, or protocols, open hearts, minds, and eyes. It’s better when it’s open.

As such, Ably will over time, where practicable, start publishing content that sits within our private knowledge sharing platforms here in an open and public platform.
